Preference mechanism.

<p>Unified access to preferences defined in "mondrian.properties"
file, as Java system properties (using <code>-Dproperty=value</code>),
as connect-string parameters, and set programmatically. Preferences
have scope (system, connection, schema, statement) so that different
parts of the system can be running with different preference
values.</p>
